## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rave Test Public And Private Keys](https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis)
- [Rave Live Public And Private Keys](https://rave.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)


## Installations

> To use rave react native SDK in your application, you need to have `Node` and `npm` downloaded and installed on your machine.

- [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install `Node` to your machine, `npm` is always automatically installed when you install `Node`.

- To ensure you have `Node` and `npm` installed, enter the following command into your terminal/command prompt `node -v` and `npm -v` respectively.

- To run `react native` on your machine you can use `npm install -g expo-cli` to install [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/) a command line utility to get you started quickly or use this command `npm install -g react-native-cli` to install the [react native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

## Deployment

> To Implement Rave By Flutterwave easily with React Native

- Go to [Flutterwave Rave Live](https://rave.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis) to get your **`LIVE`** public and private key
- Go to [Flutterwave Rave Test](https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis) to get your **`TEST`** public and private key

`NOTE: ` Set the production option to `true` or `false` depending on your deployment environment.

## How It Works

This is a simple demonstration of how to set up a simple react native app and integrate `rave react native SDK` into it.

Using the [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/) command line utility, Enter the following command to get started:

  - `expo init AwesomeProject`
  - `cd AwesomeProject`
  - `npm start`

- You should get this from your terminal:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/expo-barcode.PNG" style="max-height: 400;" alt="Expo Terminal Image">
</p>

- Install the Expo client or mobile application from [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) or [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www)

- Open the Expo client app you installed on your mobile phone, then scan the barcode displaying on the terminal on your PC.

- If successfully scanned and built, your app should load up on your mobile phone with the result in the image below;

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/app-working.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="React Native Test UI">
</p>

### Integrating Rave React Native

You can pull in react-native-rave into app with the steps below;

- Change directory into your current project directory from your terminal and enter this command:
  > npm install react-native-rave --save
  ### OR
  > yarn add react-native-rave

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/npm-install-rave.PNG" style="max-height: 150;" alt="npm-install-rave image">
<p>

  `Note:` To use `Yarn` on your machine [Click Here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

  Next use any of the payment options by following the processes  [below](#payment-options).

## Setting Up a Simple Webhook with NodeJs and ngrok to receive Rave Webhook request

#### `Note:` You might need to set up a webhook for all your transactions but mostly for mpesa and ghana mobile money to receive webhook request from Rave to verify transactions that occurs on your mobile application.

- Ensure you have `node` and `npm`, if not [refer to this for guide](#installation).
- Next register and download `ngrok` [here](https://ngrok.com/download).
- Extract the downloaded `ngrok` zip file.
- Set your extracted ngrok file to be globally available i.e set it to the environment variable by following this steps:
  - For Windows Users - On the search box on the taskbar of your desktop, search for System (control panel).
  - Click the advanced settings and then click on the environment settings, like this:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/env-variable.PNG" style="max-height: 400;" alt="Environment variable settings">
  </p>

  - Next copy the ngrok file path and add it to the enviroment variable by selecting the path option and clicking on the edit option like this: 

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/ngrok-settings.PNG" style="max-height: 400;" alt="Adding ngrok to the environment variable">
  </p>

- For MacOS users, to have ngrok up and running on your machine, follow the process:
  - Download `ngrok` [here](https://ngrok.com/download)
  - Extract/Unzip it to your Applications directory
  - Create a symlink to ngrok with this commands from your terminal:
    -  cd into your local bin directory

        `cd /usr/local/bin`
    - create symlink
    
    `ln -s /project/ngrok ngrok`
    - now cd into your project directory and reference it like this from you terminal
    - /project/ngrok `[your-port-number]`

- To ensure this successfully done, enter the command `ngrok -v` in your Terminal, it should return the version of ngrok you are currently running.

- Next create a new project directory, change directory into it and create a new project file like this:

  - `mkdir test-webhook`
  - `cd test-webhook`
  - `touch app.js`
- Next run `npm init` command to initialize your package.json file
- From your project directory install the following `npm` dependencies:

  - `npm install body-parser --save`
  - `npm install express --save`
  - `npm install express-winston --save`
  - `npm install winson --save`
  - `npm install -g nodemon` - an npm package for debugging node applications.

  Or Simply: `npm install body-parser express express-winston winston --save`

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/npm-packages.PNG" style="max-height: 400;" alt="Adding ngrok to the environment variable">
  </p>


- Next we add the following code into our `app.js` file.

```

'use strict';

var express = require('express'); // required to create http server

var bodyParser = require('body-parser'); // required to parse incoming request bodies

var app = express().use(bodyParser.json()); // creates http server

var winston = require('winston'); // data logger

var expressWinston = require('express-winston'); // required to create middleware that log http requests

expressWinston.requestWhitelist.push('body');

var port = process.env.PORT || 3000 // setting the port the server should listen to

process.env.SECRET_HASH = "your-rave-secret-hash" // making the secret hash you set in your dashboard available to the environment variable

app.set('port', port);


/*

using expressWinston to parse webhook http requests to display in the console 
and also write into a .txt file called combined.log.

*/

app.use(expressWinston.logger({
    transports: [
        new winston.transports.Console({
            json: true,
            colorize: true
        }),
        new winston.transports.File({
            filename: 'combined.log',
            level: 'info'
        })
    ]
}));


//  Set the port the server is listening to 

app.listen(port, () => console.log('Webhook is listening to port: ' + port));

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))


/* 

Set your webhook url that will be listening for webhook requests from rave server,
This is required to receive requests from rave server, verify the data received from the server 
and give your customer value.

*/

app.post("/webhook-url", function (req, res) {
    /* It is a good idea to log all events received. Add code *
     * here to log the signature and body to db or file       */

    // retrieve the signature from the header
    var hash = req.headers["verif-hash"];

    if (!hash) {
        // discard the request,only a post with rave signature header gets our attention 
        res.send({
            status: "error"
        });
        process.exit(0)
        // console.log("no hash sent");
    }

    // Get signature stored as env variable on your server
    const secret_hash = process.env.SECRET_HASH;

    // check if signatures match

    if (hash !== secret_hash) {
        // silently exit, or check that you are passing the write hash on your server.
        res.send({
            status: "error"
        });
        process.exit(0)
        // console.log("has is not equal sent");
    }

    // Retrieve the request's body
    var request_json = req.body;

    // Give value to your customer but don't give any output
    // Remember that this is a call from rave's servers and 
    // Your customer is not seeing the response here at all

    res.send(200);
});

```
- Now let's make our webhook url from our local server available to public on the internet with `ngrok`, we are using this method for this project.
  `Note:` This can also be achieved by making your webhook url available to live cloud services like `heroku`, `AWS`, `netlify` and `so on`.

- First we need to login to your [`ngrok`](#https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/login) dashboard to get your authorization token, from here:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/ngrok-dashboard-auth.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="ngrok authorization token">
  </p>

- Then from the terminal change directory into the project directory and run the following command:
  - `ngrok authtoken <your-authorization-token>` 
  - `ngrok http <the-port-number-your-node-app-is-listening-to>`

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/ngrok-auth.PNG" style="max-height: 400;" alt="ngrok-auth-token">
  </p>

- If successfully setup, your webhook url should be up live with this result: 

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/ngrok-start.PNG" style="max-height: 400;" alt="ngrok-start">
  </p>

- Now we add our webhook url to our rave dashboard here:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/rave-webhook-url.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="rave-webhook-url">
  </p>

- Then from the terminal we need to run `nodemon app.js` to start our application and ensure it is listening to the port like this:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/MaestroJolly/rave-react-native/blob/master/img/nodemon-listening.png" style="max-height: 400;" alt="nodemon listening">
  </p>
- Our webhook is now up and running to receive webhook requests from rave.
